## 🧭 Executive Summary

This project explores a Portuguese bank's direct marketing campaign dataset using R. The goal is to uncover insights into customer behavior and campaign success factors using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

## 💼 Business Problem

A retail bank wants to better understand what influences a customer to subscribe to a term deposit after a marketing campaign. Key questions include:
- What demographic factors affect subscription?
- Which contact methods and times are most effective?
- Are there trends based on job, education, or past campaign outcomes?

---

## 🔍 Methodology

- **Data Import & Cleaning:** Loaded dataset into R, cleaned missing values and recoded variables for clarity.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Used `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `skimr` to summarize, group, and visualize trends.
- **Visualizations:** Created histograms, boxplots, and bar charts to explore relationships between features like age, job, education, and the campaign outcome.
- **Insights:** Evaluated balance between subscribers and non-subscribers and identified patterns in call duration and contact type.
